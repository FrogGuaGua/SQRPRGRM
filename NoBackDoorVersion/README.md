## Configuration For Server-to-Server (S2S)

In order to enable cross-server communication, add the domain and IP address of the other groups' servers in the configuration file. This is shown in the example below, where the details of groups 11, 3, 4, 6, and 2 are added. Settings for the server are found in `JsServer/configuration.json`. Adjust these settings to suit your environment after connecting to the same subnet in the network.

```json
{
    "server": [
        {   # Other Groups Servers Details Examples
            "domain": "s11",                  
            "address":"10.13.101.178"
        },
        {
            "domain": "s3",
            "address":"10.13.83.163"
        }
        ,
        {
            "domain": "s4",
            "address":"10.13.101.145"
        }
        ,
        {
            "domain": "s6",
            "address":"10.13.81.121"
        }
        ,
        {
            "domain": "s2",
            "address":"10.13.89.245"
        }
  ],
  # Application Server Details
  "defaultServerPort": "5555",
  "defaultClientPort": "4567",
  "defaultDomainName": "s1",
}
``` 
## Server-to-Server Testing
Our team has conducted interoperability tests with 9 other groups to verify server-to-server communication capabilities. As of our most recent evaluation on Sunday, our application demonstrates successful connectivity and communication with groups 3, 4, 10, and 11. 

## Security Considerations

- **Encryption:** All messages are end-to-end encrypted.
- **Environment Variables:** Stored sensitive data like encryption keys in environment variables.
- **Authentication:** Implemented strong passwords policy and *secure remote protocol* is employed for autentication.
- **Validation:** Ensured proper validation and sanitization of all user inputs.
- **Secure Data Storage** Passwords are hashed with salt then stored in the database.

## Performance Optimization Techniques

- **Task Queues:** Use task queues to manage background tasks efficiently.
- **Database Indexing:** Implement indexing in the SQLite database for faster query execution.
- **Connection Pooling:** Use WebSocket connection pooling to manage multiple connections efficiently.

## Troublingshooting Guide

- In case of WebSocket connections' instability, if there are problems sending or receiving messages, log out of the chatroom and then log in again to re-establish the connection.
- Use appropriate commands for your operating system (macOS or Windows), as syntax and file paths may differ between platforms.
- Ensure Node.js and npm are updated to the latest compatible versions to avoid dependency conflicts and leverage new features.
- Maintain the original file and directory structure of the project to prevent import errors and ensure proper functionality.
- Verify network stability and ensure required IP addresses are accessible, as unstable connections or blocked IPs can disrupt the application's communication.
- Check for port conflicts and modify the configuration if necessary, ensuring the designated ports (5555, 4567) is available for the application's use.
- Configure firewalls and antivirus software to allow the application's network traffic, creating exceptions if needed to prevent communication blockages.
